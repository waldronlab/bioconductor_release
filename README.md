# About waldronlab/bioconductor_release

The `bioconductor_release` Docker container makes some minor
modifications to Bioconductor's `bioconductor/release_core2` container
for convenient desktop/laptop usage. For more information and for
usage instructions, please see:

Note that the [bioconductor](https://github.com/waldronlab/bioconductor_devel/blob/master/bioconductor)
script hosted there can also be invoked as `bioconductor release` to run this image.
